## Why typescript
- typescript adds types => helps to build less error prone application.
- we can write next generation javascript features (compiled down for older browsers)
- we can write non javascript features like interfaces or generics.
- Meta-programming features like decorators.
- Rich Configuration options.

## VsCode (extensions)
- EsLint
- Path Intellisense
- Meterial Icon Theme
- Prettier Formatter

## server
- npm init
- npm install --save-dev lite-server or npm install -D lite-server
- npm start

## 
- tsc app.ts --watch
- tsc --init  => to create tsconfig.json file 
- tsc -w

##
- node app.ts
- script => start => tsc && node out/app.js
- script => start => lite-server

##
- npm install request lodash --save
- process.argv => command line args in node =>  node start kailash


## notes
- javascript is dynamically typed(resolved at runtime) which means it is perfectly fine if we have variable that initailly hold number and we can later asign string to it.
- typescript is statically typed(set during development) that mease we get error in development time when we try to change the type of the variable. so we are forced to be clear
  about the types.
